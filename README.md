# Task-Tracker

A Task Tracker application developed using React, featuring three columns—ToDo, Doing, and Done—to visually organize tasks based on their status. Users can easily add, update, delete tasks, and move them across columns as they progress, providing a clear and intuitive overview of task management. The app also implements offline fonts for faster loading and consistent typography. Additionally, it leverages local storage to save task data in the browser.
